# Azure Storage Queue adapter


## QueueSource

You can create a `Source` for the Storage Queue either via `Source.FromGraph(new QueueSource)` or by calling the `QueueSource.Create` method. 

By default the `Source` will completes the stream with failure if a call to the queue for new messages failed, you can change that behavior by using `Restart` or `Resume` `SupervisionStrategy`.

```csharp
QueueSource.Create(Queue, pollInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
    .WithAttributes(ActorAttributes.CreateSupervisionStrategy(Deciders.ResumingDecider))
```

The `Source` reads messages in batches from the queue and then emits the single messages into the stream, once all messages are emitted another request is send to the queue. The number of messages that are requested per batch can be configured via the `prefetchCount` parameter, by default 10 messages. If you want a behavior were the source is making the request for new messages while the messages from the previous request are still not completely processed, you can easily do that by adding a `Buffer` directly after the `Source` like this: 

```csharp
QueueSource.Create(Queue, pollInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
    .Buffer(5, OverflowStrategy.Backpressure)
```

This will send the next request to the queue once the first five messages have been processed with five messages left in the `Buffer`.

If the queue is empty the source will periodically poll for new messages, this interval can be configured via the `pollInterval` parameter, by default 10 seconds.

Additional parameter for the `CloudQueue.GetMessagesAsync` call can be set via the `options` parameter.


## QueueSink

You can create a `Sink` for the Storage Queue either via `Sink.FromGraph(new QueueSink)` or by calling the `QueueSink.Create` method or use the extension method `ToStorageQueue` on a `Source<CloudQueueMessage, TMat>` directly.
The `Sink` is materialized into a `Task` which will be completed with `Success` when reaching the normal end of the stream, or completed with `Failure` if there is a failure signaled in the stream.

You can configure different behaviors if a message couldn't be added to the queue by using the `SupervisionStrategy` attribute, the following behaviors are available: 

- `Stop`: Default behavior, completes the stream with failure. 
- `Resume`: Sends the message again. 
- `Restart`: Skips the current message and continues with the next message.  

  
Additional parameter for the `CloudQueue.AddMessageAsync` call can be set via the `options` parameter.

## Examples

You can find some examples in the [test project](https://github.com/Silv3rcircl3/Akka.Streams.Azure/tree/master/src/Akka.Streams.Azure.StorageQueue.Tests).
